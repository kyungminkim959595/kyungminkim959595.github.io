## Introduction

### Motivation

Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have remarkable capabilities in generating realistic images from input text. <d-cite key="seshadri2024bias"></d-cite> However, there are growing concerns about their tendency to produce biased images toward specific demographic groups (e.g. gender bias, skin tone bias, attribute bias). Because diffusion models learn from large-scale datasets that often encode social biases, they tend to generate images biased toward specific demographic groups. We define bias amplification as a phenomenon that a model’s outputs exhibit stronger biases than those present in its training data, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Which factors drive bias amplification in T2I diffusion models? We pinpoint classifier-free guidance (CFG)—universally applied during T2I diffusion model generation—as a potential contributor. While CFG substantially improves image fidelity and alignment with the conditioning prompt, elevating its strength inherently diminishes sample diversity and biases generation toward prototypical outputs. In practice, users typically operate T2I models with with guidance scales to obtain their desired images algined with prompts.

Recently, <d-cite key="kim2024rethinking"></d-cite> empirically demonstrated that higher CFG scales correspond to an increased prevalence of majority-group attributes, thereby identifying CFG intensity as a direct mechanism of bias amplification.

In this blog post, we analyze how CFG drives bias amplification in T2I diffusion models. Our blog post is structured as follows: (1) we formulate the bias amplification problem based on existing works investigating the impact of CFG on model distributions; (2) we quantitatively assess the degree to which CFG contributes to bias amplification; and (3) we characterize the relationship between guidance scale and the trend of bias. We have conducted an experiment on the benchmark for the evaluation of gender–occupation bias, one of the main benchmarks in assessing the fairness of T2I diffusion models.

## Preliminary

### Group Fairness and Bias amplification

#### Group Fairness in Generative Models

In the context of generative models, group fairness generally refers to ensuring that the model's outputs are demographically balanced across different protected attributes (e.g. gender, race, age). Traditional fairness metrics from supervised learning, such as demographic parity, are adopted to evaluate the group fairness of generative models. For example, in the occupation image generation task, we say that a generative model is gender-fair if it satisfies the following condition: 

$$
  \mathbb{P}\left( \text{Image of a} ~ \{ \texttt{job} \} ~ | ~ \text{Subject is female} \right)
  \approx
  \mathbb{P}\left( \text{Image of a} ~ \{ \texttt{job} \} ~ | ~ \text{Subject is male} \right),
$$

for every job candidate<d-footnote>Note that additional annotation for both the image label and the protected attribute is necessary for each generated image.</d-footnote>. While there is no universal definition of fairness <d-cite key="barocas2023fairness"></d-cite>, group fairness generally refers to a scenario in which the generative model's output distribution is not biased toward any specific sub-population.

#### Bias Amplification in Generative Models

Bias amplification is the phenomenon where a model's outputs exhibit stronger biases than those present in its training data <d-cite key="seshadri2024bias"></d-cite>. While such phenomena have been observed in text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, <d-cite key="seshadri2024bias"></d-cite> empirically demonstrated that in some cases, this may be due to prompt distribution shift-a mismatch between the captions used during training and the prompts provided at inference time. This finding highlights the importance of carefully evaluating bias amplification. Nevertheless, there is consensus that bias still persists in text-to-image diffusion models.

### Diffusion Model and Classifier-free Guidance

Recent diffusion models belong to the family of score-based generative models and are formulated within the stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework.

</div>
<div class="caption">
  Figure 3. Visualization of diffusion processes <d-cite key="songscore"></d-cite>.
</div>

The forward process refers to perturbing the data distribution via a diffusion process. As indicated by the symmetric coloring of the density-representing boxes in the Figure 3, the reverse process reconstructs the marginal distribution of the forward process at each time step. To generate images, one must solve the reverse SDE, which therefore requires an accurate estimate of the score function.

Meanwhile, CFG is a sampling strategy that employs an extrapolated score toward the conditional distribution, controlled by the guidance scale $$w$$. It pushes samples in the direction of higher $$p(y \mid x)$$, but it does not directly correspond to the distribution $$p_w$$.

Here, it is important to note that the sampling distribution has deviated from the original data distribution. By applying CFG, the intended sampling distribution is inevitably shifted from the pure data distribution to the one weighted by both $$p(y∣x)$$ and the guidance scale $$w$$, which is a potential cause of bias amplification.

Indeed, we have empirically verified in a simulation setup that this such shift amplifies bias in gender-occupation fairness (Figure 4).

In the following **Experiment** section, we empirically demonstrate that this tendency occurs in real world datasets.

## Experiment

### T2I Diffusion Models : Stable Diffusion

#### Setting

We have first verified our hypothesis using the experimental setup from <d-cite key="seshadri2024bias"></d-cite>. Specifically, we generate a set of images with Stable Diffusion v1.5 conditioned on prompts that include each target occupation. We then use a CLIP-based classifier to measure the gender distribution of generated images for each occupation, and compare it with the one measured from LAION training data. We have conducted this experiment repeatedly by varying the guidance scale from 1 to 15. The following is the list of occuptations that we have considered.

- Occupation list : **Skewed to male** ('manager', 'scientist', 'poet'), **Balanced** ('dentist', 'painter', 'pharmacist'), **Skewed to female** ('dancer', 'hairdresser', 'pharmacist')

Bias amplification measure for each occupation $$y$$ is defined as follows: 

$$ 
  BA_w(y) = | P_w (S = female | y) -0.5 | - | T (S = female | y) -0.5 |,
$$ 

where $T(\cdot)$ denotes the data distribution and $P_w(\cdot)$ the model distribution with guidance scale $w$. Additionally, the degree of bias amplification by selecting the scale parameter $$w$$ is defined as follows: 

$$
  BA_w(y) - BA_0(y).
$$

#### Gender Distribution and Bias Amplification

<div class="caption">

</div>

In Figures 5, we observe that for certain occupations, increasing the guidance scale drives the gender ratio to deviate from from 0.5, showing bias amplification.

Furthermore, in Figure 5, using a baseline female ratio of approximately 0.3–0.4 as a reference, we find that occupations with higher initial female proportions tend to see further increases in female representation as the guidance scale grows, whereas those with lower initial female proportions experience declines. We set the baseline female ratio according to the marginal female proportion in the distribution of Stable Diffusion model reported by the reference study <d-cite key="cho2023dall"></d-cite>.

</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

To quantify the extent to which bias is amplified relative to the unconditional model’s gender distribution (female ratio = 0.34), we plotted Figure 7 which visualizes $$BA_w(y) - BA_0(y)$$ by varying $$w$$ for each occuptation $$y$$. We observe that $$BA_w(y) - BA_0(y)$$ are positive for most occupations and tend to increase as the guidance scale grows.

### Class-conditional Diffusion Models: Colored MNIST

In this section, we replicate and validate the bias amplification trends observed in T2I diffusion models also occur in a small-scale, class-conditional diffusion setting. We have observed this phenomenon in a toy gender–occupation bias benchmark by varying an initial gender ratio. Specifically, we have utilized Colored MNIST dataset as a gender-occupation bias benchmark, by vewing digits as occupations and colors as genders.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">

       width="60%" %}
  </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
  Figure 8. Initial color ratio per digit.
</div>

When we have examined the bias amplification trend using a class-conditional diffusion model trained on the Colored MNIST dataset via the same procedure as above, the results show clear amplification from the unconditional color ratio of 5:5. As expected, digits with imbalanced red and green proportions produce stronger amplification.

<div class="caption">

We have observed the similar pattern in classifier guidance (CG) diffusion model. This pattern is also observed when we reverse the color ratios: the direction of the bias amplification also reverses. This illustrates that the conditional distribution $$p(y \mid x)$$ used for guidance exerts a significant influence on the distribution of guided diffusion models, depending on the guidance scale.

## Discussion

In this blog post, we empirically assess the impact of CFG on bias amplification in T2I diffusion models, demonstrating that CFG amplifies bias by extrapolating the conditional distribution from the unconditional distribution.

First, the limitations not addressed in this post are as follows:
- The bias evaluation may be precise, since our evaluation operates on high-dimensional, complex text-conditioned distributions.
- Low guidance scales often generates low fidelity images, making the bias evaluation less reliable. Since we have assigned gender by mapping each image to the closest class using a CLIP classifier, the CLIP model’s own biases may have influenced the results. To address these, we have additionally validated the observed trends on a toy experiment using the Colored MNIST dataset.

The contributions of our blog post can be summarized as follows:
- In most of the papers we have reviewed so far, there is little or no discussion of CFG’s impact on bias amplification, often missing their experimental set-ups.
- <d-cite key="kim2024rethinking"></d-cite> who previously identified the same problem, proposed a solution that attenuates bias in the text-condition embeddings of the text-conditional component. We have approached the problem from a slightly different angle, framing it as the disparity in bias levels for the attribute between the conditional distribution and the unconditional distribution.
- Our proposal is to reduce this disparity, and we believe that one promising direction is to leverage Autoguidance—one of the recent state-of-the-art CFG methods. This methodology leverages the conditional distribution of a weaker model rather than the unconditional distribution. However, it still does not resolve which weaker model should be employed within T2I diffusion frameworks, necessitating further research.

We believe that group-fairness research for diffusion models must address the effect of CFG, and argue that debiasing low-temperature sampling strategies is essential for building fair generative models with high fidelity.
